# Learn Microservices with Spring Boot - v3

This project contains the version 3 of the application that is developed under the scope of the book *Learn Microservices with Spring Boot*. You can get a copy of the book on [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2FSB2ME) or [Apress](http://www.apress.com/book/9781484231647).

The book shows you how to evolve a simple Spring Boot application to become a full Microservices Architecture, using Spring Cloud Eureka, Ribbon, Zuul and Hystrix to implement Service Discovery, Load Balancing, the API Gateway pattern and a Circuit Breaker. Besides, you'll learn how to implement End-to-End tests with Cucumber, an Event-Driven system and the best practices when building Microservices.

## About this version

This is the first version in which we have a working social-multiplication application. 
You can play with it by running the Spring Boot application and navigating with your browser to 
`http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

Our social-multiplication application follows now a 3 layered design, and contains unit tests for the *service* and
*controller* layers.
